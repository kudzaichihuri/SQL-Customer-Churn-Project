# SQL Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Why do even wealthy, low-risk customers leave their bank? 💡  

This project explores one of the biggest challenges in the banking sector: **customer churn**. Using SQL and MySQL Workbench, I analyzed churn patterns to uncover which customer groups are most likely to leave and what factors drive their decisions.  

The project highlights surprising insights, including the fact that even **high-balance, high-credit customers churn** — proving that traditional risk indicators are not enough.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Investigate **customer churn drivers** using SQL.  
- Identify **at-risk segments** (by gender, age, geography, tenure, balance, and product usage).  
- Translate raw data into **business insights and recommendations**.  

---

## 🔎 Methodology  
1. **Database Setup**: Imported churn dataset (CSV) into MySQL Workbench.  
2. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Used `COUNT()` and `IS NULL` to detect missing values and duplicates.  
   - Verified data consistency for analysis.  
3. **Segmentation Analysis**:  
   - Designed SQL queries around gender, geography, balance, and tenure.  
   - Measured churn rate by segment.  
4. **KPI Development**:  
   - Overall churn rate.  
   - Churn rate by country.  
   - Churn rate by gender.

## 📊 Key Findings  
- ✅ **Clean data** – no duplicates or nulls.

- 🌍 **Geography** – Germany shows the highest churn.  
- 💰 **Balance** – low balances churn more, but even high-balance customers leave if dissatisfied.  
- ⭐ **Products** – 2-product customers are most loyal, while 4-product customers churn the most.  
- ⏳ **Tenure** – early months are most vulnerable; mid-tenure customers are most loyal.
